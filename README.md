# vk_cube_ansi_C89
#### Vulkan cube Demo, but I downgraded to the ANSI C 89 standard.

## Works Fine !...
  

to compile you can use an x32/386 compiler or higher.  

To start the program, you need a GPU compatible with Vulkan drivers.  

## Used Compilers  
(MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0   
Open Watcom 1.9  


#### !! I did it during my free lunch time. Maybe there are errors that I didn't see in the code, maybe it can't work on your computer


## Why made for the c89?

because it's easier for me to understand this pattern, and also because of watcom  

## [ALERT !] : I only tested on Windows.



# !! [ERRORS]
 Hardware : GTX 1060 = 0  
 Hardware : Intel(R) HD Graphics 530 = 1  


Does not work with Vulkan 1.0, only with 1.1 or higher
